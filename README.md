This repository contains data and code necessary to reproduce the results shown 
in the manuscript "Rates of palaeoecological change can inform ecosystem 
restoration" (doi: https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2623).

The repository includes:
- a script to get the raw data that are required for further data analyses 
    into shape (see folder "data_raw"), and
- three scripts to reproduce the Figures shown in the manuscript ("01_", "02_",
    and "03_").
- In addition, it includes 'utility' functions that are required to run a 
  function that was modified from the R-Ratepol package (Mottl et al., 2021), 
  as the 'utility' functions are not exported by the R-Ratepol package.
