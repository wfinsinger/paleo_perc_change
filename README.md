This repository contains data and code necessary to reproduce the results shown 
in the manuscript "Rates of palaeoecological change can inform ecosystem 
restoration".

The repository includes:
- a script to get the raw data that are required for further data analyses 
    into shape (see folder "data_raw"), and
- three scripts to reproduce the Figures shown in the manuscript ("01_", "02_",
    and "03_").
In addition, it includes functions that are required to run a function that was
  modified from the R-Ratepol package (Mottl et al., 2021), as the functions
  are not exported by the RRatepol package.
